Definitions
There are some important concepts to be defined first, which I provisionally do as follows, pending consensus:

AFIW Index - Aliveness, Feeling, Intelligence and Wisdom index
Aliveness - life manifested in life-forms before they die
Animation - doing work this always includes work to maintain aliveness
Beings - separate sapient life-forms. Normally unique but not in every case
Code - the information containing rules or algorithms used to transfer operating information for life-forms and instructions necessary to create new life-forms
Culture - potentially transferable behaviours, ideas, information and values of beings persisting outside of any code
Entities - separate non-sapient life-forms within a species. Usually unique but not in every case
Life - the capacity perpetuated in code for utilisation of free energy for animation shared by all life-forms 
Life-forms - all entities and beings that manifest life and have some ability to adapt to their environment and do work. Usually capable of variation in code as between each life-form and reproduction or replication but not in every case
Genus - a number of species that have relatively recent common ancestry or high degree of similar common code that has developed from a prior common code base and that usually continue to share more common characteristics than exists normally between different species
Negative Capability - the value of humility, doubt and acceptance of a degree of irreducible uncertainty, including by way of redundancy and variation in code as an evolutionary strategy and in any strategy for assessing or seeking to obtain utility optimal outcomes
Sapience - the ability of sentient entities to think, the capacity for intelligence, having a degree of self-consciousness / self-reflection and the potential ability to exercise wisdom
Self-protecting - having a distinctness or boundary from the surrounding environment and a degree of separateness from other life-forms that a life-form will usually try to maintain, protect or defend
Self-centred - a life-form having excessive regard for the life-form's own wants and needs or that of its community or species at the disproportionate expense of the needs of other life-forms and species and that is not utility optimal
Sentience - the ability of entities to feel things and/or perceive things
Species - the largest class of entities that are capable of carrying and transferring (alone or interacting with other members of the same class) the necessary code needed for the genesis of new entities based substantially on that code. The code of a species is usually not fully interoperable with that of another species
Utility Optimal - any decision or action that in principle results in a greater payoff (including reduction in harm or risk of harm) for the greatest number of affected life-forms and usually in a greater aggregate (in sum) payoff - even if it leads to a reduced payoff for one or more affected life-forms
Work - the transfer of energy to matter causing displacement of matter
Wisdom - the capacity of a being to reflect on its own knowledge and experience to make better decisions or gain more valuable insights about the deeper nature of things. 

Any practice of beings that incorporates Negative Capability as a core element is a manifestation of Wisdom.
Perhaps on the sapience-wisdom spectrum we can add, at the more advanced end, the following:
to be able to be part of a culture and a transferor of that culture 
to be able to look beyond immediate form or appearance and consider the underlying structure or nature of matter, things, relationships or events

It is obvious, yet necessary to state, that the different qualities of aliveness, feeling, intelligence and wisdom are not likely to be binary qualities. It will always be a question of degree within the defined spectrum. This understanding, and suitable principles of equivalence, are also necessary to avoid discrimination between similar life-forms and species.
