The following are some important concepts to be defined  provisionally, pending consensus.
●	AFIW Index – aliveness, feeling, intelligence and wisdom Index
●	aliveness – life manifested as animation in life-forms before they die
●	animation – doing work; this always includes work to maintain aliveness
●	axiom – an objective proposition of truth that is capable of falsification and has not yet been successfully falsified
●	belief – a perspective of a life-form about the nature of things, including ethics, truth, utility and wisdom
●	body – any matter having rest-mass
●	code – the information-containing rules or algorithms used to transfer operating information for life-forms and instructions necessary for the creation of new life-forms
●	consensus – sufficient agreement by the relevant group of stakeholders using the Consensus Engine
●	consensus engine – the distributed, decentralised and secure method of decision-making 
●	compassion – the recognition of life in all life-forms, the application of wisdom to suffering and the recognition of suffering in other life-forms, including use of the imagination to consider the potential suffering of other life-forms
●	compossible  – the capability of life-forms to exist and persist successfully together, having freedom of action. In respect of the maximal diversity of life-forms, it refers to the greatest set of life-forms that are capable of symbiotic relationships among one other. In respect of freedom of action, it refers to those actions that tend to foster greater freedom of action for all life-forms
●	courage – the willingness to accept one’s own suffering and acknowledge the suffering of other life-forms in order to persist in the face of adversity with useful work 
●	culture – potentially transferable behaviours, ideas, information and beliefs of sapients, persisting outside of any code
●	death – the permanent loss of aliveness
●	degree of freedom – the maximum number of values that are free to vary within a field or sphere of action
●	discrimination – distinguishing between things or states that are essentially different
●	diversity – the tendency to variation or to having variety
●	ethics – decisions made in respect of the economic, financial, political, communication and legal actions, processes and systems of sapients
●	ethical framework – the structure and processes for ensuring the validity and efficacy of an ethics that is based on axioms, laws and consensus
●	equitability – similarity or difference in the treatment of different life-forms that is likely in principle to increase the ability to do useful work and exercise freedom of action and that is objectively justifiable
●	extinction – the potentially irreversible end of the perpetuation of a species or sub-species
●	freedom of action – an action or series of actions of a life-form, group of life-forms or species that in respect of the value being measured is a statistically unusual distance from the average action or series of actions of life-form(s) in the surrounding population 
●	field – a physical region in which bodies may act and can be acted upon by other bodies
●	genus – a group of species that have relatively recent common ancestry or a high degree of similar common code that has developed from a prior common code base and that usually continue to share more common characteristics than exist normally between different species
●	good – decisions that use wisdom to decide  the utility of potential actions  that involve more than one life-form
●	inequality – an objective difference between things or states including matter, energy and life-forms that has the capacity in principle to be useful in respect of freedom of action. In practice, as between life-forms, it may be the result of arbitrary starting conditions or unfair discrimination that does not foster equitable conditions for freedom of action
●	inequity – a relative difference in treatment between life-forms that is likely in principle to reduce the ability to exercise freedom of action and is not objectively justifiable
●	inter-subjectivity – shared perspectives or beliefs of life-forms on some qualities about the nature of things and that may or may not represent an objective or invariant axiom 
●	intelligence – any practice or capability of life-forms that enables the maintenance of aliveness, successful adaptation to difficult or new conditions and the exercise of freedom of action
●	invariance – the appearance of axioms to be true and unchanged despite differences or changes in locality (space-time)
●	laws – the primary or superior rules for sapient actions made in accordance with an ethical framework
●	life – the capacity  shared by all life-forms perpetuated in code for the utilisation of free energy for animation
●	life-forms – all things that manifest life and have some capability to adapt to their environment and do work - they are usually capable of variation in code as between each other, and reproduction or replication, but not in every case
●	maximal diversity – the maximal number of different components within a field that are compossible with each other
●	negative capability  – the value of humility, expectation of error in knowledge and acceptance of a degree of irreducible uncertainty, including by way of redundancy and variation in code, as an evolutionary strategy, or any practice of sapients that incorporate these values in their culture 
●	negative entropy – a thing or state that is a statistically unusual distance from the more normal random nature of its surroundings 
●	objective – verifiable or falsifiable beliefs about fact, truths and the nature of things as well as processes and methods for obtaining the same or disseminating the same that are intended to be made without bias, emotion, bad faith or falsity
●	sapience – the ability of sentient life-forms to think, the capacity for intelligence, the possession of a degree of self-consciousness and self-reflection and the potential ability to exercise wisdom
●	sapients – sentient life-forms having sapience - usually unique but not in every case 
●	self-protection  – a distinctness or boundary from the surrounding environment and a degree of separateness from other life-forms that a life-form will usually work to try to maintain, protect or defend and the inertia of a life-form to the destruction of its parts
●	self-centredness – excessive regard of a life-form for its own wants and needs or those of its community or species at the disproportionate expense of the needs of other life-forms and species that is not objectively justifiable 
●	sentience – the capacity of life-forms to feel, or perceive things and subjectively experience aliveness 
●	species – the largest class of life-forms that are capable of carrying and transferring (alone or interacting with other members of the same set) the necessary code for the genesis of new life-forms based substantially on that code; the code of a species is usually not fully interoperable with that of another species
●	subjectivity – perspectives or beliefs of life-forms about the nature of things based on the particular perception of a life-form. It may or may not also reflect an inter-subjective, objective or invariant proposition of the nature of things
●	suffering – pain or distress felt by sentient life-forms
●	utility – usefulness; also actions that are considered better/beneficial/good/valuable/worthwhile when referring to the preferred choice of work 
●	utility optimality – the objective justifiability of any decision or action that in principle results in a greater payoff (including reduction in harm or risk of harm) in utility for the greatest number of affected life-forms and usually in a greater aggregate payoff for all affected life-forms, even if it leads to a reduced payoff for one or more affected life-forms
●	unfair discrimination – exercising the capacity to distinguish between things arbitrarily, subjectively or inter-subjectively usually with reference to the selection and application of criteria that are not substantively objectively justifiable and tend towards inequitable outcomes 
●	work – the transfer of energy to bodies causing displacement of bodies or the exercise of intelligence
●	wisdom – the capacity of sentient life-forms to reflect on their own knowledge and experience to make better decisions or gain more valuable insights about the deeper nature of life, life-forms and the nature of things
