There are some important concepts to be defined provisionally pending Consensus:
AFIW Index - Aliveness, Feeling, Intelligence and Wisdom index
Aliveness - life manifested as Animation in Life-Forms before they Die
Animation - doing Work, this always includes Work to maintain Aliveness
Axiom - an Objective proposition of truth that is capable of falsification and has not yet been successfully falsified
Belief - a perspective of a Life-Form about the nature of things including Ethics, truth, Utility and Wisdom
Body - any matter having rest-mass
Code - the information-containing rules or algorithms used to transfer operating information for Life-Forms and instructions necessary to create new Life-Forms
Consensus - sufficient agreement by the relevant group of stakeholders using a Consensus Engine
Consensus Engine - a distributed, decentralised and secure method of decision-making 
Compassion - to recognise the Life in all Life-Forms, the application of Wisdom to Suffering and the recognition of Suffering in other Life-Forms including use of the imagination to consider the potential Suffering of another Life-Form
Compossible - Life-Forms capable of existing and persisting successfully together having freedom of action. In respect of the maximal diversity of Life-Forms, the greatest set of Life-Forms that are capable of symbiotic relationships between each other. In respect of Freedom of Action, those actions that tend to foster greater Freedom of Action for all Life-Forms
Courage - willingness to accept oneâ€™s own Suffering and acknowledge Suffering of other Life-Forms in order to persist in the face of adversity with Useful Work 
Culture - potentially transferable behaviours, ideas, information and Beliefs of Sapients persisting outside of any Code
Degrees of Freedom - the maximum number of values that are free to vary within a Field 
Die - permanent loss of Aliveness
Discrimination - distinguishing between things or states that are essentially different
Diversity - tending to variation or having variety
Ethics - decisions made in respect of the economic, financial, political, communication and legal actions, processes and systems of Sapients
Ethical Framework - the structure and processes for ensuring the validity and efficacy of Ethics that is based on Axioms, Laws and Consensus
Equitable - a similarity or a difference in treatment of different Life-Forms that is likely in principle to increase the ability to do Useful Work and exercise Freedom of Action and that is Objectively justifiable
Extinction - the potentially irreversible end of the perpetuation of a Species or sub-Species
Freedom of Action - an action or series of actions of a Life-Form, group of Life-Forms or Species that in respect of the value being measured is a statistically unusual distance from the average action or series of actions of Life-Form(s) in the surrounding population 
Field - a physical region in which Bodies may act and can be acted upon by other Bodies
Genus - a number of Species that have relatively recent common ancestry or high degree of similar common Code that has developed from a prior common Code base and that usually continue to share more common characteristics than exists normally between different Species
Good - decisions about Utility that involve more than one life-form that make use of Wisdom
Inequality - an objective difference between things or states including matter, energy and Life-Forms that has the capacity in principle to be useful in respect of Freedom of Action. In practice, as between Life-Forms, it may be the result of arbitrary starting conditions or Unfair Discrimination that does not foster Equitable conditions for Freedom of Action
Inequity - a relative difference in treatment between Life-Forms that is likely in principle to reduce the ability to exercise Freedom of Action and is not Objectively justifiable
Inter-subjective - shared perspectives or Beliefs of Life-Forms on some qualities about the nature of things and that may or may not represent an Objective or Invariant Axiom 
Intelligence - any practice or capability of Life-Forms that enables maintaining Aliveness, successfully adapting to difficult or new conditions and for exercising Freedom of Action
Invariant - Axioms that appear to be true despite differences or changes in locality 
Laws - the primary or superior rules for Sapients actions made in accordance with an Ethical Framework
Life - the capacity shared by all Life-Forms perpetuated in code for utilisation of free energy for Animation
Life-Forms - all things that manifest Life and have some ability to adapt to their environment and do Work. Usually capable of variation in Code as between each Life-Form and reproduction or replication - but not in every case
Maximal diversity - the maximal number of different components within a Field that are Compossible with each other
Negative Capability - the value of humility, expectation of error in knowledge and acceptance of a degree of irreducible uncertainty, including by way of redundancy and variation in Code as an evolutionary strategy or any practice of Sapients that incorporate these values in their Culture 
Negative Entropy - a thing or state that is a statistically unusual distance from the more normal random nature of its surroundings
Objective - verifiable or falsifiable Beliefs about fact, truths and the nature of things as well as processes and methods for obtaining the same or disseminating the same that are intended to be made without bias, emotion, bad faith or falsity
Sapience - the ability of Sentient Life-Forms to think, the capacity for Intelligence, having a degree of self-consciousness and self-reflection and the potential ability to exercise Wisdom
Sapients - separate Sentient Life-Forms having Sapience - usually unique but not in every case
Self-protecting - having a distinctness or boundary from the surrounding environment and a degree of separateness from other Life-Forms that a Life-Form will usually Work to try to maintain, protect or defend and the inertia of a Life-Form to the destruction of its parts
Self-centred - a Life-Form having excessive regard for their own wants and needs or those of their community or Species at the disproportionate expense of the needs of other Life-Forms and Species that is not Objectively justifiable 
Sentience - the capacity of Life-Forms to feel, or perceive things and experience Aliveness Subjectively
Species - the largest class of Life-Forms that are capable of carrying and transferring (alone or interacting with other members of the same set) the necessary Code needed for the genesis of new Life-Forms based substantially on that Code - the Code of a Species is usually not fully interoperable with that of another Species
Subjective - perspectives or Beliefs of Life-Forms about the nature of things based on the particular perception of a Life-Form. It may or may not also reflect an Inter-subjective, Objective or Invariant proposition of the nature of things
Suffering - pain or distress felt by Sentient Life-Forms
Utility - usefulness, also actions that are considered better/beneficial/Good/valuable/worthwhile when referring to the preferred choice of Work 
Utility Optimal - any decision or action that is Objectively justifiable and in principle results in a greater payoff (including reduction in harm or risk of harm) in Utility for the greatest number of affected Life-Forms and usually in a greater aggregate payoff for all affected Life-Forms - even if it leads to a reduced payoff for one or more affected Life-Form
Unfair discrimination - exercising the capacity to distinguish between things arbitrarily, Subjectively or Inter-subjectively usually with reference to the selection and application of criteria that are not substantively Objectively justified and tend to Inequitable outcomes 
Work - the transfer of energy to Bodies causing displacement of Bodies or the exercise of Intelligence
Wisdom - the capacity of Sentient Life-Forms to reflect on their own knowledge and experience to make better decisions or gain more valuable insights about the deeper nature of Life, Life-Forms and the nature of things 

Perhaps on the Sapience spectrum we can add the following: The potential capability of a Life-Form to be part of and a transferor of Culture
